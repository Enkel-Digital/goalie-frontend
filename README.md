# Goalie
Goalie frontends using Vue and Quasar.
Goalie is yet another Todo App that helps you track your todos and how your todos are connected/contributing to your goals.


## Install the dependencies
```bash
# Using yarn instead of npm as npm has some issues on windows, and there are some quirks when used with quasar
yarn install
```


### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```


### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
